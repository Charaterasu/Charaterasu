Why hello there

I'm an aspiring application developer and have no clue what to write here

uhh..

I like Overwatch (Doomfist OTP), Yu-Gi-Oh! (certified D/D/D and Dogmatika player) and some animes / mangas I suppose (romance best)

Guilty Gear also ain't so bad, Brisket and Faust are fun to play

if you try to take away my music then behold the power of nothing cus I can't do anything about it other than cry

I'd also really appreciate it if I got work

..well yeah 

that's about it

good ol' me ain't that interesting
