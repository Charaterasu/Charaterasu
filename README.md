Why hello there

I'm an aspiring application developer and have no clue what to write here

uhh..

I like Overwatch, Yu-Gi-Oh! and some animes I suppose

Guilty Gear also ain't so bad, Brisket and Faust are fun to play

also if you try to take away my music then behold the power of nothing cus I can't do anything about it other than cry

I'd also really appreciate it if I got work - thanks in advance

..well yeah 

that's about it

good ol' me ain't that interesting
